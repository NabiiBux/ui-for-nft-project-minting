### customization
You can customize the UI by changing the code. If you just want to modify some values you can instead
- modify `settings.tsx` to change the texts and Image. 
  - `image` is the main image that is shown. You could change it to your project logo.
  - `headerText` is the website header. You could change it to your project name.


modify allowlist.json and add the wallets you wish to whitelist.
